# Manuscript
We copied the `author.tex` as `author-orig.tex`, and then modified the `author.tex` directly.

Note that `latex_template_old.zip` has the original paper, and `latex_template` has the one after everybody modified the manuscript on Overleaf (11/6/18).

We will extract the manuscript at this stage, and create a new version for arxiv, in folder `arxiv`.
